# Validity 91

This project aims at reverse engineering the protocol of the Validity 138a:0091 fingerprint sensor that is found on the XPS 15 9560, XPS 13 9360 and potentially other laptops. Apart from a few edge cases, this part is done. Yay! The reverse engineering the sensor for the XPS 15 9570 is out of scope but being done in a different [repository](https://github.com/IDerr/Goodix92).

Unfortunately, the matching algorithm used in the previous libfprint driver doesn't work with this sensor.
They seem to rely on a single high quality image to do the matching, something that is never obtained.
See this issue for [more details](https://github.com/hmaarrfk/libfprint/issues/4#issuecomment-372041342).

This sensor should be pretty straightforward to reverse engineer since apparently it doesn't encrypt the traffic between the sensor and the OS.
A big thanks to Nikita Mikhailov, from whom I learned that it is likely just unencrypted traffic.
They are working on a [similar project](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90) for a sensor that has encryption capabilities

Wireshark was used to sniff through traffic sent to and from the USB.

# Getting started

## Running prototype
You can use ~~conda~~ (not until 3.7 comes out because i decided to use `dataclasses`)
 if you like, but I provided a `Pipfile` that should make it easy to use [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/).
### Installing pipenv
  1. `pkcon install pipsi`
  2. `pipsi install pipenv`

### Run the script
Change to the project directory, and run
  1. `pipenv install`
  2. `sudo make permissions`
  3. `pipenv run python3 prototype.py`

Or you may choose to run it within spyder
  3. `pipenv run spyder3`
  4. Open the `prototype.py` file
  5. Run it within Spyder

## Wireshark development
The main strategy is to use Wireshark and a Windows Guest OS running in VirtualBox to capture all the traffic between a working Windows implementation and the sensor.
I don't really think this is SUPER necessary. I was able to obtain a dump
of the enrollment process on windows.
  1. Install libusb: `pkcon install libusb-devel`
  3. Install Wireshark: `pkcon install wireshark`
    1. Set it up to capture [USB output](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB)
    2. Use `lsusb` to find what USB bus the fingerprint sensor is connected to:
      1. `Bus 001 Device 003: ID 138a:0091 Validity Sensors, Inc.`
  4. Install VirtualBox: `pkcon install VirtualBox`
  5. Install [VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  6. Allow VirtualBox to run off your [existing Windows partition](https://www.serverwatch.com/server-tutorials/using-a-physical-hard-drive-with-a-virtualbox-vm.html)
    * Warning, I kinda got activation warnings from Microsoft. I think they might be related to doing this. It might be more prudent to have a separate virtual drive running an unactivated version of Windows 10 but I just don't have the hard drive space for it.
  7. Run Windows10, and capture the fingerprint output.

Add your user to the `vboxusers` group so you can share the USB devices:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers $USER
```
you might need
```
sudo make wireshark
```

to set the correct wireshark permissions for USB sniffing.
You might want to use a wireshark filter like:

```
usb.addr == "1.6.0" || usb.addr == "1.6.1" || usb.addr == "1.6.2" || usb.addr == "1.6.3" || usb.addr == "1.6.4"
```

# Helping out
This code doesn't send anything to the cloud. But, if you want to help develop this, considering sharing the difference in your dump file, `dump.txt`.
I don't think it contains any personal information. As far as I know, I don't dump the fingerprint data.

I think the easiest way is to post a diff on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/):
```bash
git diff dump.txt
```
and copy the output.

Let me know if you got a semblance of a fingerprint from the script.
# Reverse engineering
So I am working off a single dump using my VirtualBox and Windows10 trying to log on to my computer.
I'll try to share a new dump file from the enrollment procedure.

That should teach us how to detect when a finger is taken off too. But honestly, I don't know how to do this without making my fingerprints public on the web...

Here is a sample from the script from the side of my fingers:

  * [Validity90](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90) works on doing this for sensors with encrypted traffic.
  * [libfprint-vsf0090](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Other-Linux-Discussions/Validity-Fingerprint-Reader-Linux/m-p/3352145) Apparently made a PPA for fprint with the validity 0090 sensor
  * [libfprint](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint/) did this a while back for many sensors. Apparently we need to work toward this
